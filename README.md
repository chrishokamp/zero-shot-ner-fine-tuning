Zero- to Few-Shot NER Fine Tuning Lab

This lab shows students how to use new open source zero shot NER models, general purpose LLM APIs, and open-source annotation interfaces to:

- define new type(s) and create evaluation datasets for them
- quickly evaluate off-the-shelf models on specific types
- build configurable training datasets for new types
- fine tune zero-shot models for better performance
- evaluate fine-tuned models
